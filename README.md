# kickstarter-analysis
## Objective:
The objective of this project was to provide our client Louise with a detailed analysis of kistarter campaign data, so she could achieve her crowdfunding goals and start her play _Fever._ We used a variety of analytical tools to best sort and visualise the data so Louise's campaign could be successful.

## Analysis and Challenges:
### Analysis:
We started our analysis by creating pivot tables and pivot charts so we could easily filter the data that most closely matched Louise's project.  The first filters we applied allowed us to visualize the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects based on the month of the year they were launched.  The line graph [Theater Outcomes based on Launch Dates](https://github.com/kowiak89/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) shows this data.
